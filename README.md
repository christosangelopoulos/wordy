If a letter appears **green**, that means that this letter **exists in the secret word, and is in the right position**.

If a letter appears **yellow**, that means that this letter **exists in the secret word, but is in NOT the right position**.

If a letter appears **red**, that means that this letter **does NOT appear in the secret word AT ALL**.

### Dependencies

* As mentioned above, this script is using the word list contained in `/usr/share/dict/words`.

  If your distro doesn't include this installed, you can install the respective package (`wordlist`, `words`) using the respective command (`apt`, `pacman`).

* Another, much less important dependency is [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat).

 `lolcat` helps show the *Statistics* in **color**, and therefore more fun.
